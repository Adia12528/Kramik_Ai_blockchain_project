## 🚀 New Capabilities

### 1. Pattern Recognition
Your AI now understands **intent**:
- "write code" → Code generation
- "debug this" → Debugging assistance  
- "explain" → Detailed explanation
- "optimize" → Performance tips
- "compare" → Side-by-side comparison

### 2. Code Analysis
Automatically analyzes code:
- Detects language (Python, JS, Java, C++, Go, Rust)
- Calculates complexity (O(1), O(n), O(n²))
- Finds issues (var, ==, empty catch blocks)
- Suggests improvements

### 3. Multi-Language Support
Generate same algorithm in **7 languages**:
🐍 Python | 📜 JavaScript | ☕ Java | ⚡ C++ | 🔷 Go | 🦀 Rust | 💻 C

### 4. Expanded Knowledge (50+ Topics!)

#### 🤖 Machine Learning (NEW!)
- Linear/Logistic Regression
- K-Means Clustering  
- Neural Networks
- Gradient Descent

#### 🏗️ System Design (NEW!)
- Load Balancing
- Caching (LRU, Write-Through)
- Microservices
- Database Sharding

#### 🎨 Design Patterns (NEW!)
- Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy
- Complete implementations

#### 🔒 Security (NEW!)
- JWT Authentication
- Encryption (AES, RSA, bcrypt)
- OWASP Top 10
- SQL Injection Prevention
